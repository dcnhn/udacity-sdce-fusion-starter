# Track 3D-Objects Over Time

### 1. Write a short recap of the four tracking steps and what you implemented there (filter, track management, association, camera fusion). Which results did you achieve? Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?
In the final project, we have to develop the multi-target tracking of objects using recordings from the Waymo Open Dataset.
To succeed in the tracking, four tasks had to be solved:
1. Implement the equations of the Kalman Filter
2. Set up up the track management
3. Develop the association between the tracks and the sensor measurements
4. Integrate the camera sensor data into the tracking

#### 1. Kalman Filter Implementation



### 2. Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)? 


### 3. Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios? Did you see any of these challenges in the project?


### 4. Can you think of ways to improve your tracking results in the future?
